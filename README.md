## Development

### Generating a New Component

To create a new web component, run the following command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

You will be prompted to provide the name of the new component. This will scaffold the necessary files and folder structure for the component in the appropriate package directory.

### Example Workflow

1. Generate a new component:
   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```
   Provide a unique name for your component when prompted. Don't include the 'ucds' prefix as it will be appended.

2. Implement the component logic and styles in the generated files.

3. Add your component to Storybook for documentation:
   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

4. Write tests and run them using Web Test Runner to ensure quality.

   Make sure you build your component before testing it. Either change to the directory of the new component and run:
    ```bash
   npm run build 
   ```
   Or you can run it from the monorepo root:
   ```bash
   npm run build -w @ucalgary-design-system/<your-component-name-here>
   ```
   
   Run the tests for your new component similar to how you built your component. Either from the component directory:
    ```bash
   npm run test 
   ```
   Or you can run it from the monorepo root:
   ```bash
   npm run test -w @ucalgary-design-system/<your-component-name-here>
   ```

5. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add <component-name>"
   git push
   ```
